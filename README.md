This chat app allows users to create groups for coworkers, their friends, family, etc.  Each group can have separate channels to discuss different topics.  They can also share documents or images uploaded from their machines. Obviously each user will create a unique account on the app before using it. We are going to hash their passwords using BCrypt to keep their login secure.  We are utilizing Pug as an HTML templating engine to easily and dynamically generate our content on the page.  This allows for succinct, dry code that accomplishes the job very efficiently.  We are also using web sockets to transmit data packets in real time so users can see each otherâ€™s posts. We will also need some sort of storage/database for user posts, and also user documents as we want that ability as well.
